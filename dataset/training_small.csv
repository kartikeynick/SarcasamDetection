The people in here complaining that ""omg Apple is fucking Android users"" is just not true.

Sure there should be an easier way to reroute iMessages after getting rid of your phone, but to say they're somehow choosing to shaft Android users is just fucking silly.

The vaping community is amazing to where there are no words to describe it. Everyone is helpful, friendly, and just all around cool. The best part is there is no criticism on what you vape with(at least from what if seen). I had bought my first device 2 months ago which was a ijust2 and I thought it was the coolest thing until I walked into my local vape shop and saw everyone using mod boxes and some crazy shit I've never even herd of. At that moment I was intimidated because here I was with this little starter kit and these guys were running big dogs. I got to talking to some of them and I was nervous to tell them what I was using because I thought I would get criticized for what I had. But instead it was the complete opposite. This is the only community so far that I actually feel apart of and know if I need help you guys would be there to give me suggestions and for that I thank all of you.

As my personal hypothesis, a large staple of casual gaming belief is that a game is meant to be played how it is out of the box, and that tampering with the settings removes the ""fun"" aspects from the game. However, what confuses me to no end, is how the consistent casual Halo player cannot wish to grasp onto a balanced competitive atmosphere, considering the majority of their online gameplay is traditionally in team based gametypes wherein you are trying to defeat another team. That core concept in and of itself screams that every Halo fan should look to play on an even playing field that offers the ability to improve as a player. Yet often times when we, the competitive community, offer solutions to this problem, we are met with disinterest and sometimes backlash. It's all very confusing to me as to why this continues to be the case, but I agree with your points on why H5 can be a different case. Diminishing the leap that a casual gamer has to make to be a part of the competitive community can only make it easier for Halo 5 as an eSports title to take root and solidify its place for years to come. Casual gamers playing the same game as competitive gamers only bridges the community, as the one goal that both sets of communities strive for will be the same, therefor more common ground is established, populations increase and help each other thrive, and its just all around easier for all forms of gamers to be able to connect with one another. There are some key points that could be argued against a competitively influenced design direction, but if thoroughly tested and proven to be successful, there really doesn't seem to be much of a reason NOT to take this route over others. At the end of the day, building the game competitively is going to give it longevity while still offering a very entertaining experience for casual gamers looking for quick fast and fun games and a rewarding experience for competitive gamers wanting to improve and become the best they can be."

In the west the usual suspects are OU, KU, &amp; UT. But the common understanding of the B1G's motivations is flawed. In early 2010 prior to expansion there were very definite signs that the Big Ten had four schools in mind. Texas, Rutgers, Nebraska, and Maryland. Three of those schools were added and the fourth had confirmed talks with the Big Ten but couldn't make a deal work. There is no evidence that the B1G wants to add more eastern schools. There is no evidence of more ACC teams moving to the B1G. Just speculation by the media and fans. And to top it off the B1G just received another blockbuster deal and conferences rarely expand right after signing a brand new contract (because that is a pretty dumb thing to do). It's really no expansion or Texas as the B1G's current mindset."

Basically the jury accepted the science. 3) Some portions of the remains are fused with tire wire which Avery himself claimed to have burned. If he is responsible for burning the tires, he burned the body. 4) He has a cut on the same finger which would possibly make contact with the ignition switch area which is where the blood was found. 5) DNA from Sweat isn't obtained from a blood vial with EDTA. It came from Avery and was found under her car hood. 6) People testified seeing him burn plastic where TH's phone and other items where found. 7) He split the scene of the crime and was up in his Dad's hunting cabin.
